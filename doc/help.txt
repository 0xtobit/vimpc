MAPPING KEYS
--------------------------------------------------

Any key combination can be mapped to any other key combination including
to ex mode commands.

To create a map, the command :map is used which will map the key
combination provided as the first parameter to the second.

i.e. map FF :browse<C-M>gg/

This will make the normal mode input FF change to the browse tab, go to the
first line and then enter search mode. All ex mode or search commands
you want to execute must be terminated by <C-M>, <Return> or <Enter>
otherwise you will stay in that mode.

Ctrl key combinations are mapped using <C-x> where x is the key

i.e <C-D> to map ctrl+d

Alt key combinations work in the same way.


KEYS:

As well as regular ascii keys other keyboard keys can be
mapped and are described below.
   
   <Down>, <Left>, <Right>, <Up> | Directional keys
   <PageUp>, <PageDown>          | Page up and down
   <C-x>                         | Ctrl+x
   <A-x>                         | Alt+x
   <Enter>                       | Enter key
   <Return>                      | Return key
   <BS>                          | Backspace key
   <Del>                         | Delete key
   <lt>                          | Less than symbol 
   <F1>, <F2>, etc               | Function keys


PRINT FORMATS
-------------------------------------------------

The song and library formats used to print the songs can be set using
the settings songformat and libraryformat respectively. The formatting
of these strings is based upon those of ncmpcpp.

   %a  - Artist
   %b  - Album
   %t  - Song title
   %n  - Track number
   %l  - Duration
   %f  - Filename/URI

   $R  - Begin right alignment
   $E  - Add ellipsis for trimmed text (must be before right align)
   $H  - Toggle highlight color off/on
   {,} - Will only display contents between { and } if not empty
   \|   - Alternative to use if prior entry is blank

Examples:
   The default song format is: "{%a - %t}\|{%f}$E$R $H[$H%l$H]$H"
   This displays artist - title if they both exist otherwise
   displays the filename and displays the duration aligned
   to the right. The $H ensures that [ and ] will not change
   color when that song is highlighted.

   The default library format is: "$H[$H%l$H]$H {%t}\|{%f}$E$R "
   This displays the duration, again not highlighting [ and ]
   followed by a space, then either the song title or if that
   is empty the filename.
